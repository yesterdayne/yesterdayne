if you are here you are probably from ponytown! hi! i don't talk much in-game, i am not the best at conversing with strangers but i'll do my best.

i use she/her pretty much exclusively, but i do not mind if you refer to me as the pronouns of whatever character i am cosplaying at the time. i also don't mind if you use the character's name to refer to me, but don't expect me to do any rp type stuff!

usually i am either sitting in the bakery, outside the bakery, or SOMETIMES near spawn, i don't usually talk. that doesn't mean i wont, tho! if you wanna talk about one of my interests i am more likely to be talkative vs just general smalltalk haha.

"how do you stay in ponytown all day without getting disconnected?" you see i have no life, i am literally at my computer and i am just clicking on the screen to make sure i don't go afk off and on.

PS! i most likely won't add you to my friends list unless we've at least talked beforehand! don't take it personal, i just don't want my friends list flooded with people i don't know at all lol ;_;

**the best way for me to notice you is to whisper me**, *but sometimes i still manage to miss whispers!*

if you have a skin from the same show/game/whatever as me, feel free to sit next to me and hang if you want! just don't expect me to really talk much, but i don't mind if we silently vibe around each other!

if i'm hanging w/ someone it's usually my friend [jinxx](https://github.com/JinxxedVexx)! they are my bestie and we like to make matching ponies :) ! also she's a great artist so u should like check him out.

<sub>if its not obvious i am currently obsessed with princess bubblegum from adventure time. specifically her vampireworld counterpart from fionna and cake, but i love all bonnies. she makes me feel unwell and i want to smash her with a hammer. i am literally thinking of her like constantly she's like a stupid little pink parasite and i NEED to be euthanized.</sub>

--------------------------------

*ummm i don't generally do DNI's (i will usually figure out if i want to talk to you or not fairly quickly) but i will say if u are someone who thinks princess bubblegum is similar to hitler or she's "evil" or think she's a groomer or something literally **GET AWAY FROM HER!!! GET A JOB!!!!!***
* on this note, i am not someone who thinks that she did nothing wrong. she did! she sure did! but 90% of the people who bring it up constantly overblow or misread situations purely because they just don't like her and assign human morality to a non-human person.*

*oh! if you're a minor and you're on the 18+ server don't talk to me! i don't like when kids decide to intrude on adult spaces because they think "they're mature enough".*

--------------------------------

please don't copy my skins completely, but i don't mind if you take inspiration from them!
