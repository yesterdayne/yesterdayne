> **note! lately i haven't been feeling super talkative, i mostly have just been logging on to look at ponies & watch conversations while i'm doing something else on my other screen. please don't get offended if i don't respond to you! whispering is the best way to get me to respond, but i might not hold convos long.**

*i am not super conversational in the first place, i do not do very good with small talk and if i do manage to get into a conversation i get burnt out very fast. please try to be patient with me!!*

i like when people come and just sit with me silently! if you ever just want to hang around me with no pressure to talk feel free, i don't mind it!

if you do decide to sit around/near me though- please be mindful of other people's spaces! i don't like accidentally hiding other people's ponies who are just there vibing.

if i'm in-game and not timing out, then i am at least near my computer and consciously clicking to make sure i don't d/c.

**the best way for me to notice you is to whisper me, but _sometimes i still manage to miss whispers!_**

if i'm hanging w/ someone it's usually my friend [Jinxx](https://github.com/jinxxedvexx)! they are my bestie and we like to make matching ponies :) ! also she's a great artist so u should like check him out.

i am not really personally involved in any fandom spaces. i interact with art and stuff but i'm not like in the trenches. any media i like i am just on the fringes of usually.

> *i don't really do DNI's, but if you try to argue with me or get a rise out of me about things i like, i will most likely just hide you or ignore you. i do not get on the internet to argue with random people about shit i enjoy.*

*please don't copy my skins completely, but i don't mind if you take inspiration from them!*
