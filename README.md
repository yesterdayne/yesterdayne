hello, i'm dayne! i'm 30 years old, my pronouns are she/her, and i am gray-asexual & sapphic.

--------------------------------

if you are here you are probably from ponytown! hi! i don't talk much in-game, i am not the best at conversing with strangers but i'll do my best.
sometimes you might see me sitting in the bakery or in specific fandom spaces, i don't usually talk, i am probably just people watching!

i like just watching people's convos and looking at everyone's skins.

the best way for me to notice you is to whisper me, but sometimes i still manage to miss whispers!

if you have a skin from the same show/game/whatever as me, feel free to sit next to me and hang if you want! just don't expect me to really talk much, but i don't mind if we silently vibe around each other!

ummm i don't generally do DNI's (i will usually figure out if i want to talk to you or not fairly quickly) but i will say if u are someone who thinks princess bubblegum is similar to hitler or think she's a groomer or something literally GET AWAY FROM HER!!! GET A JOB!!!!! i will not want to talk to you

--------------------------------

please don't copy my skins completely, but i don't mind if you take inspiration from them!

if you want to learn more about me, you can check out my strawpage or carrd! : )
