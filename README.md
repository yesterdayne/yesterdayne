> **IF MY PONY HAS "MUTE" IN THE NAME; I WILL STILL REPLY TO CROWNS/COMPLIMENTS! I AM JUST NOT WILLING TO HOLD CONVERSATIONS AT THE MOMENT.**

> **IF I'VE REMOVED YOU FROM MY FRIENDS LIST PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT AS AN INSULT! i am clearing out my friends list except for people i know very well!**

*i am not super conversational in the first place, i do not do very good with small talk and if i do manage to get into a conversation i get burnt out very fast. please try to be patient with me!!*

i like when people come and just sit with me silently! if you ever just want to hang around me with no pressure to talk feel free, i don't mind it!

if you do decide to sit around/near me though- please be mindful of other people's spaces! i don't like accidentally hiding other people's ponies who are just there vibing.

i generally sit in the middle island under the bakery or nearby if there's no open spots, but you might sometimes find me near spawn. just very rarely usually. if i'm in-game and not timing out, then i am at least near my computer and consciously clicking to make sure i don't d/c.

**the best way for me to notice you is to whisper me, but _sometimes i still manage to miss whispers!_**

if i'm hanging w/ someone it's usually my friend [Jinxx](https://github.com/jinxxedvexx)! they are my bestie and we like to make matching ponies :) ! also she's a great artist so u should like check him out.

i am not really personally involved in any fandom spaces. i interact with art and stuff but i'm not like in the trenches. any media i like i am just on the fringes of usually.

> *DNIs uhh i guess if you're fatphobic, any of the generic racist/sexist/homophobic, use the r-slur (even reclaiming, yes.), if you think adults drawing nsfw is wrong (?), idk if you're just rude in general or specifically try to rile people up*

> _**minors on 18+ server dni pls, ty! i don't hate minors, its just that i'm 30+ years old and have no interest in befriending or talking to them.**_

*please don't copy my skins completely, but i don't mind if you take inspiration from them!*
