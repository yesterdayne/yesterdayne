if you are here you are probably from ponytown! hi! i don't talk much in-game, i am not the best at conversing with strangers but i'll do my best.

sometimes you might see me sitting in the bakery or in specific fandom spaces, i don't usually talk.

i like just watching people's convos and looking at everyone's skins. if i happen to stop right in front of you or over you i'm sorry it's not on purpose, i'll move when i realize, i am probably just looking at a different part of the screen lol.

**the best way for me to notice you is to whisper me**, *but sometimes i still manage to miss whispers!*

if you have a skin from the same show/game/whatever as me, feel free to sit next to me and hang if you want! just don't expect me to really talk much, but i don't mind if we silently vibe around each other!

i am not very good at the whole like, expression in-game type thing so sorry if i'm kind of static LOL. i get overwhelmed by my hotbar sometimes and just. Forget. if my eyes are looking in your direction it's probably an accident tbh.

if i'm hanging w/ someone it's usually my friend [jinxx](https://github.com/JinxxedVexx)! they are my bestie and we like to make matching ponies :) ! also she's a great artist so u should like check him out.

<sub>if its not obvious i am currently obsessed with princess bubblegum from adventure time. specifically her vampireworld counterpart from fionna and cake, but i love all bonnies. she makes me feel unwell and i want to smash her with a hammer. i am literally thinking of her like constantly she's like a stupid little pink parasite and i NEED to be euthanized.</sub>

*ummm i don't generally do DNI's (i will usually figure out if i want to talk to you or not fairly quickly) but i will say if u are someone who thinks princess bubblegum is similar to hitler or think she's a groomer or something literally **GET AWAY FROM HER!!! GET A JOB!!!!!***

*oh! if you're a minor and you're on the 18+ server don't talk to me! i don't like when kids decide to intrude on adult spaces because they think "they're mature enough".*

--------------------------------

please don't copy my skins completely, but i don't mind if you take inspiration from them!
